## Abstract

InfraFi Protocol introduces the first decentralized lending protocol specifically designed for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). The protocol enables owners of physical infrastructure devices—such as OORT compute nodes, Helium miners, and Filecoin storage devices—to use their operational hardware as collateral to borrow digital tokens while maintaining full earning rights from their infrastructure operations.

This whitepaper presents a novel financial primitive that bridges the physical and digital economies, creating a new asset class for DeFi while solving critical liquidity challenges in the rapidly growing DePIN ecosystem. The protocol maintains security through innovative proxy-based custody mechanisms and dynamic asset valuation systems that reflect real-time infrastructure performance.

**Key Innovations:**
- First-of-its-kind DePIN asset collateralization system
- Multi-protocol architecture supporting diverse infrastructure networks
- Dynamic asset valuation based on real-time device performance
- Non-custodial design preserving user control and earning rights
- Modular adapter system for seamless integration of new DePIN protocols

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Emergence of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks

The blockchain ecosystem has evolved beyond purely digital assets to encompass physical infrastructure through Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). These networks incentivize individuals to deploy and operate real-world hardware—such as wireless hotspots, storage nodes, compute servers, and IoT sensors—in exchange for token rewards.

The DePIN sector has experienced explosive growth, with over $25 billion in total value locked across various infrastructure networks as of 2024. Major protocols including Helium (wireless connectivity), Filecoin (distributed storage), OORT (edge computing), and Render Network (GPU compute) have demonstrated the viability of tokenizing physical infrastructure operations.

### 1.2 The Liquidity Challenge

Despite this growth, DePIN participants face a fundamental liquidity challenge: their valuable infrastructure assets are essentially illiquid. Node operators invest significant capital in hardware that generates steady returns through network participation, but accessing the underlying value requires selling the asset entirely, thereby terminating future earning potential.

This creates several critical problems:

**Capital Inefficiency**: Operators cannot leverage existing infrastructure investments to fund expansion or other opportunities without liquidating productive assets.

**Growth Constraints**: New participants face high barriers to entry due to upfront hardware costs, limiting network growth and decentralization.

**Economic Rigidity**: Infrastructure value is trapped in illiquid assets, preventing dynamic capital allocation and portfolio optimization.

**Opportunity Cost**: Operators must choose between maintaining earning assets and accessing capital for other investments.

### 1.3 Traditional Finance Limitations

While traditional finance offers asset-backed lending, several factors make conventional solutions inadequate for DePIN assets:

**Custody Complexity**: Physical infrastructure devices are geographically distributed and operationally active, making traditional custody models impractical.

**Valuation Challenges**: DePIN assets derive value from both hardware specifications and network earning potential, requiring specialized valuation methodologies.

**Operational Continuity**: Unlike traditional collateral, DePIN devices must remain operational to maintain value, creating unique custody requirements.

**Cross-Chain Integration**: DePIN networks operate across multiple blockchain ecosystems, requiring interoperability solutions beyond traditional finance capabilities.

## 2. Solution Architecture

### 2.1 Core Protocol Overview

InfraFi Protocol addresses the DePIN liquidity challenge through a novel decentralized lending system that enables infrastructure owners to borrow against their devices while maintaining operational control and earning rights. The protocol introduces several key innovations:

#### 2.1.1 Proxy-Based Custody Model

Rather than physical custody, InfraFi employs a sophisticated proxy system that manages on-chain ownership rights while preserving operator control:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User's DePIN Device] --> B[InfraFi Proxy Contract]
    B --> C[NodeVault Contract]
    C --> D[Borrowed Tokens]
    A --> E[Continued Operation & Earnings]
    E --> F[User Retains All Rewards]
```

**Key Features:**
- Device ownership is transferred to protocol-controlled proxy contracts
- Users maintain all operational control and earning rights
- Devices continue normal operation without interruption
- Automatic ownership recovery upon loan repayment

#### 2.1.2 Dynamic Asset Valuation

The protocol implements real-time asset valuation mechanisms that consider:

- **Hardware Value**: Base device specifications and market pricing
- **Earning Potential**: Historical and projected network rewards
- **Network Performance**: Device uptime, performance metrics, and network reputation
- **Market Conditions**: Token price fluctuations and network economics

### 2.2 Multi-Protocol Architecture

InfraFi's modular design supports diverse DePIN ecosystems through a unified adapter system:

#### 2.2.1 Protocol Adapter Registry

The `ProtocolAdapterRegistry` serves as the central coordination layer for supporting multiple DePIN networks:

```solidity
interface IProtocolAdapter {
    function getNodeValue(uint256 nodeId) external view returns (NodeValue memory);
    function getDepositSteps(uint256 nodeId, address currentOwner, address targetOwner) 
        external view returns (DepositStep[] memory);
    function getWithdrawalSteps(uint256 nodeId, address currentOwner, address targetOwner) 
        external view returns (WithdrawalStep[] memory);
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Supported Protocols (Phase 1)

**OORT Network**: Edge computing and AI inference infrastructure
- Node Type: Compute servers and edge devices  
- Valuation: Based on staked OORT tokens and computing rewards
- Integration Status: Live on testnet

**Future Integrations** (Roadmap):
- **Helium**: Wireless connectivity hotspots and 5G infrastructure
- **Filecoin**: Distributed storage provider networks  
- **Render Network**: GPU compute for rendering and AI workloads
- **IoTeX**: IoT device networks and sensor infrastructure

### 2.3 Vault System Architecture

```

### 3.2 Deposit and Withdrawal Mechanisms

#### 3.2.1 Node Deposit Process

The deposit mechanism ensures secure transfer of node ownership while preserving operational continuity:

```solidity
function depositNodes(uint256[] calldata nodeIds, uint256[] calldata nodeTypes) 
    external nonReentrant notInEmergency {
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < nodeIds.length; i++) {
        // 1. Verify user owns the node
        _verifyNodeOwnership(nodeIds[i], nodeTypes[i], msg.sender);
        
        // 2. Get or create appropriate proxy  
        address proxy = proxyManager.getOrCreateProxy(nodeTypes[i]);
        
        // 3. Execute ownership transfer through adapter
        _executeDeposit(nodeIds[i], nodeTypes[i], msg.sender, proxy);
        
        // 4. Record deposit and update user's collateral
        _recordSuccessfulDeposit(nodeIds[i], nodeTypes[i], msg.sender);
    }
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Withdrawal Security

Node withdrawal incorporates multiple safety checks to prevent unauthorized access:

```solidity
function withdrawNodes(uint256[] calldata nodeIds, uint256[] calldata nodeTypes) 
    external nonReentrant notInEmergency {
    
    // 1. Verify user has no outstanding debt
    require(getUserDebt(msg.sender) == 0, "OutstandingLoanMustBeRepaid");
    
    // 2. Execute withdrawal for each node
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < nodeIds.length; i++) {
        _executeWithdrawal(nodeIds[i], nodeTypes[i], msg.sender);
        _recordSuccessfulWithdrawal(nodeIds[i], nodeTypes[i], msg.sender);
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Asset Valuation System

#### 3.3.1 OORT Node Valuation

The OORT protocol adapter implements comprehensive asset valuation based on the OORT network's tokenomics:

```solidity
function getNodeValue(uint256 nodeId) external view returns (NodeValue memory) {
    address nodeAddress = nodeIdToAddress(nodeId);
    
    // Query OORT network for current node data
    (
        address ownerAddress,
        uint256 id, 
        uint256 balance,        // Total asset value (pledge + rewards)
        uint256 lockedRewards,  // Unvested portion
        uint256 maxPledge,
        uint256 endTime,
        uint256 nodeType,
        uint256 lockTime
    ) = IOortNode(oortNodeContract).nodeDataInfo(nodeAddress);
    
    return NodeValue({
        totalValue: balance,                    // Complete asset value
        liquidValue: balance - lockedRewards,  // Immediately accessible
        collateralValue: balance,               // Available for borrowing
        lastUpdate: block.timestamp
    });
}
```

#### 3.3.2 Multi-Protocol Valuation

The modular adapter system allows each protocol to implement custom valuation logic while maintaining consistent interfaces:

- **Hardware-Based Valuation**: Base device value from specifications and market pricing
- **Performance-Based Adjustments**: Rewards based on network participation and uptime
- **Risk-Adjusted Pricing**: Discounts for volatile or illiquid reward tokens
- **Time-Weighted Averaging**: Smoothing mechanisms to prevent manipulation

### 3.4 Interest Rate Model

InfraFi implements a Jump Rate Model optimized for DePIN asset characteristics:

#### 3.4.1 Rate Calculation

```solidity
function calculateInterestRate(uint256 cash, uint256 borrows) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 utilization = (borrows * BASE_POINTS) / (cash + borrows);
    
    if (utilization <= kink) {
        // Below kink: linear rate increase
        return baseRatePerYear + (utilization * multiplierPerYear) / BASE_POINTS;
    } else {
        // Above kink: jump rate kicks in
        uint256 normalRate = baseRatePerYear + (kink * multiplierPerYear) / BASE_POINTS;
        uint256 excessUtil = utilization - kink;
        return normalRate + (excessUtil * jumpMultiplierPerYear) / BASE_POINTS;
    }
}
```

#### 3.4.2 Rate Parameters (Testnet Configuration)

- **Base Rate**: 3% APY (minimum borrowing cost)
- **Multiplier**: 8% APY per 100% utilization (below kink)  
- **Jump Multiplier**: 50% APY per 100% utilization (above kink)
- **Kink**: 80% utilization (optimal supply/demand balance)
