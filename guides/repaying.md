# Repaying Loans

Complete guide to repaying your InfraFi loans with flexible options and strategies.

{% hint style="success" %}
**No Penalties**: InfraFi has no prepayment penalties. You can repay any amount at any time without fees.
{% endhint %}

## Repayment Overview

InfraFi offers maximum flexibility for loan repayment, allowing you to manage your debt according to your financial situation and market conditions.

### Repayment Benefits

- ✅ **Anytime**: No payment schedules or due dates
- ✅ **Any Amount**: Partial or full repayment options
- ✅ **No Penalties**: Zero prepayment fees
- ✅ **Immediate Effect**: Interest stops accruing on repaid amount
- ✅ **LTV Improvement**: Better position health with each payment

## Understanding Your Debt

### Debt Components

Your total debt consists of:

```mermaid
pie title Total Debt Breakdown
    "Original Principal" : 70
    "Accrued Interest" : 30
```

#### **Principal vs Interest**
- **Principal**: Original amount borrowed
- **Accrued Interest**: Interest accumulated since borrowing
- **Total Debt**: Principal + All accrued interest

### Interest Calculation

#### **Real-Time Accrual**
Interest compounds every block (~3 seconds on OORT):

```
Block Rate = Annual Rate ÷ Blocks per Year
New Debt = Old Debt × (1 + Block Rate)
```

#### **Example Calculation**
```
Starting Loan: 1,000 WOORT at 7% APY
After 30 days: ~1,017.5 WOORT
After 90 days: ~1,053.4 WOORT  
After 365 days: ~1,070 WOORT
```

## Repayment Strategies

### Full Repayment

#### **When to Repay Fully**
- ✅ **High Interest Rates**: When borrowing costs exceed opportunity cost
- ✅ **Risk Reduction**: Eliminate liquidation risk entirely
- ✅ **Position Closure**: Exit strategy for DePIN lending
- ✅ **Market Uncertainty**: Defensive move during volatility

#### **Full Repayment Benefits**
- 🛡️ **Zero Risk**: Complete elimination of liquidation exposure
- 💰 **No More Interest**: Stop all ongoing borrowing costs
- 🔓 **Full Access**: Recover complete collateral control
- 🔄 **Fresh Start**: Reset for future borrowing opportunities

### Partial Repayment

#### **Strategic Partial Payments**
- 📊 **LTV Management**: Reduce ratio to safer levels
- 💰 **Cost Control**: Lower ongoing interest burden
- ⚖️ **Balance Optimization**: Maintain some leverage while reducing risk
- 🎯 **Targeted Improvement**: Address specific position needs

#### **Partial Repayment Scenarios**

| Current LTV | Repay Amount | New LTV | Result |
|-------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| 75% | 20% of debt | 60% | Much safer |
| 60% | 10% of debt | 54% | Moderate improvement |
| 40% | 25% of debt | 30% | Very conservative |

### Interest-Only Payments

#### **When Appropriate**
- 🔄 **Maintain Position**: Keep leverage while covering costs
- 📈 **Growth Phase**: During active node expansion
- ⏰ **Temporary Relief**: Short-term cash flow management
- 📊 **Market Timing**: Waiting for better conditions
