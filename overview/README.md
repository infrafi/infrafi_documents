# What is InfraFi Protocol?

InfraFi Protocol is the **first decentralized lending protocol designed specifically for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)**. We enable owners of physical infrastructure devices to unlock liquidity from their hardware investments while maintaining full operational control and earning rights.

## The Problem We Solve

The DePIN ecosystem has grown to over **$25 billion in total value**, with hundreds of thousands of individuals operating physical infrastructure devices like:

- **OORT compute nodes** for edge computing and AI
- **Helium hotspots** for wireless connectivity  
- **Filecoin storage miners** for distributed storage
- **Render Network GPUs** for compute rendering

### The Liquidity Challenge

Despite this massive growth, infrastructure operators face a fundamental problem: **their valuable assets are illiquid**.

```mermaid

    A[High Capital Investment] --> B[Operational Hardware]
    B --> C[Steady Token Rewards]
    B --> D[Illiquid Asset Value]
    D --> E[Cannot Access Liquidity]
    E --> F[Limited Growth Opportunities]
```

**Traditional Solutions Don't Work**:
- üö´ **Selling devices** terminates future earning potential
- üö´ **Traditional loans** don't understand DePIN asset value
- üö´ **Existing DeFi** only handles digital collateral

## Our Solution

InfraFi bridges this gap with a novel lending protocol that treats physical infrastructure as **productive collateral**.

### Core Innovation: Proxy-Based Custody

Instead of taking physical custody, InfraFi uses smart contract proxies that manage on-chain ownership rights while you maintain full operational control:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Your DePIN Device] --> B[Smart Contract Proxy]
    B --> C[InfraFi Vault]
    C --> D[Borrowed Tokens]
    
    A --> E[You Keep Operating]
    E --> F[Continue Earning Rewards]
    F --> G[Maintain All Benefits]
    
    H[Repay Loan] --> I[Recover Full Ownership]
```

### How It Works

1. **Deposit Your Device**: Transfer ownership to InfraFi's secure proxy system
2. **Device Keeps Operating**: No interruption to your infrastructure operations
3. **Borrow Against Value**: Access up to 80% of your device's assessed value
4. **Keep Earning**: All rewards and benefits remain yours during the loan
5. **Repay When Ready**: Full ownership returns upon loan repayment

## Key Features

### üîì **Unlock Liquidity**
