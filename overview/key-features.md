# Key Features

InfraFi Protocol introduces several breakthrough innovations that make it the first viable lending solution for physical infrastructure assets.

## 🔄 Proxy-Based Custody System

### The Innovation
Unlike traditional collateral that requires physical custody, InfraFi uses **smart contract proxies** that manage ownership rights while preserving operational control.

### How It Works
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Proxy
    participant Vault
    participant Network
    
    User->>Proxy: Transfer device ownership
    Proxy->>Vault: Register as collateral
    User->>Network: Continue operations
    Network->>User: Rewards keep flowing
    User->>Vault: Borrow tokens
    Vault->>User: Loan proceeds
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **No Operational Disruption**: Devices continue working normally
- ✅ **Maintain Earning Rights**: All rewards remain yours
- ✅ **Security**: Automated ownership management
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Easy recovery upon repayment

---

## 💎 Dynamic Asset Valuation

### Real-Time Pricing
InfraFi assesses device value using multiple data sources:

#### **Hardware Value**
- Device specifications and market pricing
- Age, condition, and performance metrics
- Market demand and replacement costs

#### **Earning Potential**  
- Historical reward generation
- Network performance and uptime
- Future earning projections

#### **Network Health**
- Protocol token economics
- Network participation rates
- Validator performance metrics

### Valuation Formula
```
Total Asset Value = Hardware Value + Staked Assets + Earned Rewards
Available Collateral = Total Asset Value × Collateralization Ratio
```

### Live Updates
- Real-time value tracking
- Performance-based adjustments  
- Market condition responses
- Automated rebalancing

## 🌐 Multi-Protocol Architecture

### Modular Design
InfraFi's adapter system supports diverse DePIN networks through unified interfaces:

```
Core Vault System
├── OORT Adapter (Live)
├── Helium Adapter (Q2 2025)
├── Filecoin Adapter (Q3 2025)  
├── Render Adapter (Q4 2025)
└── Custom Adapters (Community)
```

### Protocol Integration Features
- **Unified Interface**: Same user experience across all networks
- **Specialized Logic**: Custom handling for each protocol's unique features
- **Cross-Protocol Risk**: Portfolio diversification across networks
- **Community Expansion**: Open framework for new integrations

### Current & Planned Support

| Protocol | Asset Type | Status | Launch Target |
|----------|------------|--------|---------------|
| **OORT** | Compute Nodes | ✅ Live | Testnet Active |
| **Helium** | Wireless Hotspots | 🔄 Development | Q2 2025 |
| **Filecoin** | Storage Miners | 📋 Planned | Q3 2025 |
| **Render** | GPU Compute | 📋 Planned | Q4 2025 |

## 💰 Competitive Interest Rates

### Jump Rate Model
InfraFi uses an optimized interest rate model designed for infrastructure assets:

```
Interest Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization × Multiplier) + Jump Rate
```

### Rate Parameters
- **Base Rate**: 3% APY minimum
- **Multiplier**: 8% per 100% utilization (below kink)
- **Jump Multiplier**: 50% per 100% utilization (above kink)  
- **Kink Point**: 80% utilization

### Rate Examples

| Pool Utilization | Interest Rate | Annual Cost on $1,000 |
|------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 20% | 4.6% APY | $46 |
| 50% | 7% APY | $70 |
| 80% | 9.4% APY | $94 |
| 90% | 14.4% APY | $144 |

### Borrower Benefits
- 🏆 **Below-Market Rates**: Competitive with traditional finance
- 📈 **Utilization-Based**: Pay less when supply is abundant
- 💵 **Partial Payments**: Flexible repayment options
- 🚫 **No Prepayment Penalty**: Repay anytime without fees
